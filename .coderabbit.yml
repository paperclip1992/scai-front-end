        - Big components that are not reusable.
        - Incorrect usage of asynchronous functions.
        - Excessive usage of external dependencies.
        - Lack of loading resource optimization.
        - Absence of tests.
        - Excessive dependency of component state.
        - Wrong handling of components life cycles.
        - Components should not have more than 25 lines of code.
